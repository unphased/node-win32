node-win32
==========

A place to store and share my win32 build of nodejs and any npm modules that I've used it with. 

The purpose of this repo is primarily to persist working binaries (and the js that drive them) for Windows. 
The reason for saving these binaries basically boils down to the fact that MS's build toolchains are awful.
